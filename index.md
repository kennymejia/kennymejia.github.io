## About Me
```markdown
Hello There! First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to look at my repository.
I am a lifelong Newburgh, NY resident who has achieved his goal of being a first generation 
college graduate in my family. I attended Orange County Community College for the first two 
years of my educational journey. I transfered out of this college with a 3.5 GPA and with 
membership in the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society. Marist College was where I graduated with my 
BS in Computer Science with a 3.7 GPA and with Magna Cum Laude Latin Honors. My concentration
is in software development and the reason for this is rather simple, because I love to code! 
What I find most fascinating is the ability to create an endless amount of programs with simple 
syntax. Any problem can be solved in many different ways but what sets every solution is 
essentially how effective the solution is in solving said problem. In this respect it is like 
a puzzle where you have to find the best answer whichever way possible.

## Projects

[**The Oregon Trail**](https://github.com/kennymejia/ProjectOT) - Fall 2018 
*Git, Node.js, Express, mySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript*

* Recreates the classic game The Oregon Trail as a single page application
* Client Side design uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some Photoshop
ie. Landing page, main menu, top scores, game setup, main game
* Server Side used a RESTful API for asynchronous client-server communication
* RESTful APIs use our routing layer to receive the message from client, determine
action to be taken, and call the correct controller to satisfy the request
* Controllers are used to translate the JSON message received
* Game saves top 10 scores to a mysql database, game will read the top 10 list from the
database and update when there are changes using prepared statements
