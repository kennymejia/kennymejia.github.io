### About Me
Hello There! First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to look at my repository.
I am a lifelong Newburgh, NY resident who has achieved his goal of being a first generation college graduate in my family. I attended Orange County Community College for the first two years of my educational journey. I transfered out of this college with a 3.5 GPA and with membership in the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society. Marist College was where I graduated with my BS in Computer Science with a 3.7 GPA and with Magna Cum Laude Latin Honors. My concentration is in software development and the reason for this is rather simple, because I love to code! What I find most fascinating is the ability to create an endless amount of programs with simple syntax. Any problem can be solved in many different ways but what sets every solution is essentially how effective the solution is in solving said problem. In this respect it is like a puzzle where you have to find the best answer whichever way possible.
