## About Me
```markdown
Hello There! First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to look at my repository.
I am a lifelong Newburgh, NY resident who has achieved his goal of being a first generation 
college graduate in my family. I attended Orange County Community College for the first two 
years of my educational journey. I transfered out of this college with a 3.5 GPA and with 
membership in the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society. Marist College was where I graduated with my 
BS in Computer Science with a 3.7 GPA and with Magna Cum Laude Latin Honors. My concentration
is in software development and the reason for this is rather simple, because I love to code! 
What I find most fascinating is the ability to create an endless amount of programs with simple 
syntax. Any problem can be solved in many different ways but what sets every solution is 
essentially how effective the solution is in solving said problem. In this respect it is like 
a puzzle where you have to find the best answer whichever way possible.

## Projects
[**The Oregon Trail**](https://github.com/kennymejia/ProjectOT) - Fall 2018  
*Git, Node.js, Express, mySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript*

* Client Side design uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript and some Photoshop
ie. Landing page, main menu, top scores, game setup, main game
* Server Side used a RESTful API for asynchronous client-server communication
* RESTful APIs use our routing layer to receive the message from client, determine
action to be taken, and call the correct controller to satisfy the request
* Controllers are used to translate the JSON message received

*Git, Node.js, Postgres, HTML, CSS, Python, SQL, JavaScript*
* Users upload source code, turn it into an image of blocks, calculate its fractal
dimension, match with an existing painting in database with similar fractal dimension
* Chosen painting is sent through a neural network API that will modify the painting
* Login page uses Facebook, Marist, and Twitter for sign up and authentication
* Users have a unique profile page with paintings created listed in descending order
* Canvas Pop API implemented so users can print created paintings

[**Operating Systems Project**](https://github.com/kennymejia/ProjectOS) - Spring 2020  
*Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript*
* “virtual” 6502 computer with our operating system sitting on top
* Logically built CPU, RAM, Clock, MMU, Interrupt Controller using Typescript
* Implemented 6502 instruction set on the virtual machine
* Created program in machine code to execute on the virtual machine

[**eSports tournament relational database**](https://github.com/kennymejia/eSportsDB) - Fall 2018  
*Oracle SQL Developer and Data Modeler*
* Wrote SQL for the creation of the tables as well as the insertion of test data
